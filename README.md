python snemovna_prezident.py
```
- Downloads PDF stenographic records
- Extracts text using multiple PDF processing libraries
- Analyzes presidential participation patterns

### 3. Senate (Historical)
```bash
python senat_scraper.py
python senat_prezident.py
```
- Selenium-based scraping for complex pagination
- Converts documents to DOCX format for analysis
- Date-based organization and filtering

### 4. Slovak National Council (1990)

- Combines multiple HTML parts per session
- Searches for qualified presidential mentions

### 5. Government Meetings (1991-2025)
Run the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook vlada_scrape_prezident.ipynb
```
- Comprehensive scraping of government meeting records
- Two-phase approach: 2009-2025 (modern) and 1991-2008 (legacy)
- Statistical analysis and visualization

## üîç Analysis Features

### Context Extraction
All scripts extract contextual information around presidential mentions:
- **Window size**: 2-3 words before and after "prezident" for the context of found matches
- **Filtering**: Only mentions followed by colons (speaker identification, which filtered majority junk) in next few following words

### Output Format
Results are saved in tab-separated format:
```
filename | context1 | context2 | context3
date    url    contexts
```

### Presidential Terms Covered
- **V√°clav Havel**: 1993-2003
- **V√°clav Klaus**: 2003-2013  
- **Milo≈° Zeman**: 2013-2023
- **Petr Pavel**: 2023-present

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Notes

### File Format Handling
- **HTML**: BeautifulSoup parsing with encoding detection
- **PDF**: Multiple extraction methods (PyPDF2, pdfplumber)
- **DOC/DOCX**: COM automation for legacy format conversion
- **Encoding**: Automatic detection for Czech characters

### Error Handling
- Robust retry mechanisms for network requests
- Graceful handling of missing or corrupted files
- Comprehensive logging of processing errors

### Performance Considerations
- Respectful scraping with delays between requests
- Progress tracking with tqdm
- Efficient text processing for large document sets
